# Machine Learning with PySpark Customer Churn Analysis

# Project Description

This project uses PySpark to build a machine learning model for predicting customer churn in a Telecommunications company. This project covers a range of essential tasks, including data loading, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature preparation, model training, evaluation, and deployment, all using Pyspark. We are going to use our machine learning model to identify the factors that contribute to customer churn, providing actionable insights to the company to reduce churn and increase customer retention.
